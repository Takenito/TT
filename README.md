# What is this?

You can check it out on [takenito.github.io](https://takenito.github.io/) and see what it does, it is really quite the simple thing.

#### TO DO:
- **(?)** "Select Words" -> into a searchable multiple selections drop-down menu, as the plan is to have 100+ words.
- Small and for fun visual/audio improvements/additions.

_By any chance, any improvements would be appreciated._
